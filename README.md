# C++ Practice
Reviewing Classic Programming Problems in C++ without BOOST

Have any advice to give? I'd love to hear it. 

Current Problems that have an implementation here: 

<ul>
  <li>Binary Search </li>
  <li>Breadth first print on a Binary Tree (sorting and array using a Binary Tree) </li>
  <li>Templated Linked List</li>
</ul>
